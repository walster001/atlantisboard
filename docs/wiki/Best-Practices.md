### Board Structure

**Column Design:**
- Start with 3-5 columns for simplicity
- Use clear, descriptive column names
- Reflect your actual workflow in column structure
- Avoid having more than 7-8 columns (becomes hard to navigate)

- Avoid ambiguous names

**Workflow Design:**

## Using Roles Effectively

### Role Assignment Strategy

**Principle of Least Privilege:**
- Assign minimum permissions necessary for users to do their work
- Start with Viewer role and increase as needed
- Regularly review and audit role assignments

**Role Selection:**
- **Viewer**: For stakeholders, clients, or observers who only need visibility
- **Manager**: For team leads who manage membership but don't edit content

**Team Structure:**
- Have 1-2 Board Admins per board for accountability
- Use Manager role for team leads
- Keep Viewer role for read-only access needs
- Use custom roles for specific permission requirements

### Permission Management

**Regular Audits:**

- Document permission changes in audit logs

**Access Control:**
- Remove access promptly when team members leave
- Change roles when responsibilities change
- Use invite links for controlled onboarding
- Monitor audit logs for unusual access changes

**Custom Role Design:**
