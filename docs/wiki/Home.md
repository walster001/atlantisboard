# AtlantisBoard Documentation

Welcome to the AtlantisBoard documentation! AtlantisBoard is a highly customizable Kanban-style project management tool designed for teams of all sizes.

## What is AtlantisBoard?

AtlantisBoard is a flexible project management application that helps teams organize work using Kanban boards. With real-time collaboration, granular permissions, and extensive customization options, AtlantisBoard adapts to your team's workflow.

## Key Concepts

Before diving into the documentation, it's helpful to understand the core concepts:

- **Workspaces**: Top-level containers that organize related boards. Workspace members automatically have access to all boards within the workspace.
- **Boards**: Individual Kanban boards containing columns and cards. Boards belong to workspaces and can be customized with themes, backgrounds, and permissions.
- **Columns**: Vertical lanes on a board that organize cards by status, stage, or category. Columns can be reordered, colored, and customized.
- **Cards**: Individual task items that move between columns. Cards contain detailed information including descriptions, attachments, labels, due dates, and more.
- **Users**: Team members who have accounts in the system. Users can be assigned to workspaces and boards with specific roles.
- **Roles**: Permission levels that determine what actions users can perform. Roles include App Admin, Board Admin, Manager, and Viewer, plus custom roles with granular permissions.

## Core Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Changes sync instantly across all users via WebSocket connections
- **Granular Permissions**: Built-in roles plus custom roles with fine-grained permission control
- **Workspace Organization**: Organize boards into workspaces for better team structure
- **Rich Card Details**: Full-featured cards with markdown descriptions, attachments, labels, due dates, and subtasks
- **Board Customization**: Themes, custom colors, background images, and branding options
- **File Management**: Upload and manage attachments, icons, and branding assets
- **Audit Logging**: Track all member and permission changes for compliance and transparency
